* **Average Casualties per Accident (2022):**
    * **Value:** (e.g., 1.36 casualties/accident - *calculated as Total Casualties / Total Accidents*)
    * **Change vs. 2021:** (e.g., -0.2% - *comparing the average for CY vs PY*)
* **Percentage of Accidents Involving Drunk Driving (2022):**
    * **Value:** (e.g., 3.5% - *calculated as Accidents with Drunk Driving / Total Accidents*)
    * **Change vs. 2021:** (e.g., -0.5% - *comparing the percentage for CY vs PY*)

## üé® Key Visualizations & Metrics

Each visualization is designed to provide granular insights and support data-driven decision-making, with added enhancements for deeper analysis.

1.  ### üóìÔ∏è Monthly Casualty Trend (2022 vs. 2021)
    * **Visualization Type:** Line Chart
    * **Insight:** This line chart visually compares the monthly number of casualties for the **Current Year (2022 - represented by a distinct line, e.g., brown)** and the **Previous Year (2021 - represented by a lighter brown line)**. It enables the identification of seasonal patterns and year-over-year changes in casualty rates, helping to understand if safety measures are effective during specific months or if certain periods require more attention.
    * **Enhancement:** Interactive hover-over tooltips display the exact casualty counts for each month for both years, providing precise data points.

2.  ### üöó Casualties by Vehicle Type
    * **Visualization Type:** Horizontal Bar Chart (with vehicle icons where available)
    * **Insight:** Highlights which vehicle types are most frequently associated with casualties.
        * **Cars:** Consistently highest number (155.8K casualties).
        * **Bikes:** Significant contribution (15.6K casualties).
        * **Vans:** (15.9K casualties).
        * **New Additions & Refinements:** The dashboard now includes distinct categories for **Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGV)** and clearly separates **Pedestrians** and **Cyclists** (which might have been grouped under "Others" previously). This allows for a more granular understanding of risks associated with different road users.
    * **Enhancement:** Each bar also displays the **percentage of total casualties** that vehicle type accounts for, providing context to the absolute numbers. The bars are sorted in descending order of casualty count for immediate impact.

3.  ### üõ£Ô∏è Casualties by Road Type & Speed Limit
    * **Visualization Type:** Horizontal Bar Chart, with potential for stacked elements or small multiples.
    * **Insight:** Indicates that **Single Carriageways** account for the vast majority of casualties (145K), followed by **Dual Carriageways** (32K), suggesting these road types require focused safety interventions.
    * **New Addition:** This visualization now includes an **analysis by common Speed Limits** (e.g., 30mph, 40mph, 60mph, 70mph) within each road type. This granular breakdown helps in understanding if specific speed limits correlate with increased casualty rates on particular road types, informing targeted enforcement or infrastructure changes.

4.  ### üèôÔ∏è Casualties Urban vs. Rural
    * **Visualization Type:** Donut Chart
    * **Insight:** Shows that a larger proportion of casualties occur in **urban areas (61.95%)** compared to rural areas **(38.05%)**. This insight is crucial for tailoring safety measures to the unique challenges of each environment.
    * **Enhancement:** The total number of casualties for both urban and rural areas is clearly displayed within the donut chart's center or as prominent labels, adding immediate context to the percentages.

5.  ### üí° Casualties by Light Condition
    * **Visualization Type:** Donut Chart
    * **Insight:** Reveals that the majority of casualties happen during **daylight (73.84%)**, but a significant portion also occurs in **dark conditions (26.16%)**. This emphasizes the importance of visibility and appropriate lighting.
    * **New Addition:** The "dark conditions" segment is now further broken down into categories like **"Darkness - lights lit," "Darkness - no street lighting,"** and potentially "Darkness - street lighting unknown," providing more actionable insights into the effectiveness of street lighting.

6.  ### üåßÔ∏è Casualties by Weather Conditions & Road Surface
    * **Visualization Type:** A new combined visualization (e.g., Clustered Bar Chart or Heatmap/Matrix)
    * **Insight:** This new visualization combines two crucial environmental factors to show their joint impact on casualties. It allows for analysis of:
        * Which **Weather Conditions** (e.g., Fine no high winds, Raining no high winds, Fog or mist, Snowing no high winds, Cloudy) contribute most to casualties.
        * How different **Road Surfaces** (e.g., Dry, Wet, Snow, Ice) interact with weather to affect accident rates.
        * For example, it could highlight that "Wet" road surfaces during "Raining no high winds" weather conditions are particularly hazardous.

7.  ### üìç Casualties by Location (UK Map)
    * **Visualization Type:** Interactive Map (e.g., Bubble Map or Choropleth)
    * **Insight:** Provides a clear geographical understanding of accident concentration within the **United Kingdom**. This allows for the identification of potential hotspots at the regional or city level, enabling targeted interventions.
    * **Enhancement:**
        * **Color/Size by Severity:** Map markers (e.g., bubbles) are dynamically sized based on the `Number of Casualties` and colored according to `Severity_Casualty` (e.g., red for Fatal, orange for Serious, yellow for Slight), providing immediate visual cues on high-impact areas.
        * **Drill-down Capability:** Users can drill down from a broader `Region` view to specific `Cities` to analyze local hotspots.
        * **Detailed Tooltips:** Hovering over a location provides comprehensive details, including `City`, `Total Casualties`, `Fatal Casualties`, `Road_Surface`, and `Weather_Conditions` for that specific area.
